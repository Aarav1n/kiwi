  <h1>Fitness in Football</h1>
  <br>
  <h3>Importance of Fitness in Football</h3>
  <p>Various exercises in the gym can have a positive effect on your footballing capacities. For example, you can improve your fitness in the gym by training on the rowing machine or treadmill that will come in very handy for your football training and matches! It will help keep going for longer or even put in a fast sprint towards the goal in the closing minutes.

  <h3>Working on your muscle mass</h3>
  <p>It can also be good to build muscle mass by working with weights. With lower body fat and greater muscle mass, you'll be stronger and faster on the football field. A strong lower body is good for shooting, jumping and turning. Upper body strength is necessary for shielding the ball, avoiding being shoulder barged off the ball and also contributes to your overall strength and energy. With a strong body, you can be sure you'll function at full capacity throughout the match.

  <h3>Confidence on the field</h3>
  <p>Building (and having) physical strength and endurance helps to build confidence in yourself as a football player. But, you will also enjoy the benefits of fitness off the field! As with all forms of exercise, the feel-good endorphins released into the body during a fitness session are important factors in relieving stress and anxiety. Fitness not only helps you be a better football player, it also contributes to your overall self-confidence and sense of well-being!
